## How It Works

Whenever you submit a request through our API, we will intelligently select the most suitable provider to fulfill the request. This selection is based on factors like cost-effectiveness, speed, and reliability of the providers. Our system keeps track of the provider used to fulfill your request, making it easy for you to query transaction status in the future.
